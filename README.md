My rewritten zephyrus store

Store system for CS:GO.
Zephyrus store system rewritten with preview support (compilable with SM 1.10) 

Not support for SM 1.11

Since this is zephyrus's store that was rewritten so any custom module that support zephyrus store can also be run without any problem. Contact me if you find any bugs or error.

Update 18/3: Re-add tf2 item support (I dont know this is gonna work or not). Please fell free to create a new issue post for bug report.

P/S: discount item has bug that all the discount will be stack (sum) if player has all the require flag in config. I dont know how to fix this so please adjust the price for individual flags. Look at my config for more info
